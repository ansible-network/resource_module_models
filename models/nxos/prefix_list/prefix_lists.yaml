options:
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the NX-OS device
      by executing the command B(show running-config | section '^ip(.*) prefix-list').
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
