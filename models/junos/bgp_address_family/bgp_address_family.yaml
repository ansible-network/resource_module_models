  author: Rohit Thakur (@rohitthakur2590)
  requirements:
    - ncclient (>=v0.6.4)
    - xmltodict (>=0.12.0)
  notes:
    - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the device being managed.
    - This module works with connection C(netconf). See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,../network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
    - Tested against JunOS v18.4R1
  options:
    running_config:
      description:
        - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
        - The value of this option should be the output received from the Junos device
          by executing the command B(show protocols bgp).
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
          and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result
