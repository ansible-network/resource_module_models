  module: junos_security_zones
  version_added: 2.9.0
  short_description: Manage security zones on Juniper JUNOS devices
  description: This module provides declarative management of security zones on Juniper JUNOS devices
  author: Pranav Bhatt (pbhatt@redhat.com)
  requirements:
    - ncclient (>=v0.6.4)
    - xmltodict (>=0.12.0)
  notes:
  - This module requires the netconf system service be enabled on the device being managed.
  - This module works with connection C(netconf). See L(the Junos OS Platform Options,https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_junos.html).
  - Tested against JunOS v18.4R1

        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
          and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.

        - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
          platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
          within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
          not required.
          behaviour for this module.
        - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
          it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
          the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
          value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
          option should be the same format as the output of command
          I(show security policies detail) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
          connection to remote host is not required.
