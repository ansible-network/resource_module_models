module: vyos_hostname
version_added: 2.8.0
short_description: Manages hostname resource module
description: This module manages the hostname attribute of Vyos network devices
author: Gomathi Selvi Srinivasan (@GomathiselviS)
notes:
  - Tested against vyos 1.1.8
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
  - The Configuration defaults of the Vyos network devices
    are supposed to hinder idempotent behavior of plays
options:
  config:
    description: Hostname configuration.
    type: dict
    suboptions:
      hostname:
        description: set hostname for VYOS.
        type: str
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the vyos device by
      executing the command B("show configuration commands | grep hostname").
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  state:
    choices:
      - merged
      - replaced
      - overridden
      - deleted
      - gathered
      - parsed
      - rendered
    default: merged
    description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
        on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
        platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
        within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
        not required.
      - The states I(merged), I(replaced) and I(overridden) have identical
        behaviour for this module.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
        the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
        option should be the same format as the output of command
        I(show configuration commands | grep hostname) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
