        - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
        - The value of this option should be the output received from the VYOS device by
          executing the command B(show configuration commands | grep ntp).
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(show configuration commands | grep ntp) option and
          transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
          and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
