  short_description: Configure BGP neighbors address family configurations on SONiC.
  description:
    - This module provides configuration management of BGP neighbors addressfamily parameters on devices running SONiC.
    - bgp_as, vrf_name and neighbors need be created earlier in the device.
  notes:
    - Tested against Enterprise SONiC, release 3.0.2.
