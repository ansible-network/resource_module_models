module: ios_bgp_global
short_description: Resource module to configure BGP.
description: This module configures and manages the attributes of global bgp on Cisco IOS.
version_added: 1.3.0
author:
  - Sumit Jaiswal (@justjais)
  - Sagar Paul (@KB-perByte)
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSXE Version 17.3 on CML.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
    See U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_ios.html)
  - The module examples uses callback plugin (stdout_callback = yaml) to generate task
    output in yaml format.
