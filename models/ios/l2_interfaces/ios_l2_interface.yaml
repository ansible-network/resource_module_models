  - Sumit Jaiswal (@justjais)
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSv Version 15.2 on CML.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
    See U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_ios.html)
  - The module examples uses callback plugin (stdout_callback = yaml) to generate task
    output in yaml format.

  running_config:
    description:
      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the IOS device by
        executing the command B(show running-config | section ^interface).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
        and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  state:
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - rendered
    - gathered
    - parsed
    default: merged
    description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
        on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
        platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
        within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
        not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and
        transform it into structured data in the format as per the resource module
        argspec and the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of
        C(running_config) option should be the same format as the output of
        command I(show running-config | include ip route|ipv6 route) executed on device.
        For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required.
