      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the IOS
        device by executing the command B(sh running-config nve | section ^l2vpn evpn$).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config)
        option and transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the
        resource module's argspec and the value is then returned in the
        I(parsed) key within the result.
