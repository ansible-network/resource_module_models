module: ios_interfaces
short_description: Resource module to configure interfaces.
description: This module manages the interface attributes of Cisco IOS network devices.
version_added: 1.0.0

- Sagar Paul (@KB-perByte)
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSXE Version 17.3 on CML.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
    See U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_ios.html)
  - The module examples uses callback plugin (stdout_callback = yaml) to generate task
    output in yaml format.

    description: A dictionary of interface options
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      name:
        description:
        - Full name of interface, e.g. GigabitEthernet0/2, loopback999.
        type: str
        required: true
      description:
        description:
        - Interface description.
        type: str
      enabled:
        description:
        - Administrative state of the interface.
        - Set the value to C(true) to administratively enable the interface or C(false)
          to disable it.
        type: bool
        default: true
      speed:
        description:
        - Interface link speed. Applicable for Ethernet interfaces only.
        type: str
      mtu:
        description:
        - MTU for a specific interface. Applicable for Ethernet interfaces only.
        - Refer to vendor documentation for valid values.
        type: int
      mode:
        description:
        - Manage Layer2 or Layer3 state of the interface.
        - For a Layer 2 appliance mode Layer2 adds switchport command ( default impacts idempotency).
        - For a Layer 2 appliance mode Layer3 adds no switchport command.
        - For a Layer 3 appliance mode Layer3/2 has no impact rather command fails on apply.
        choices:
        - layer2
        - layer3
        type: str
      duplex:
        description:
        - Interface link status. Applicable for Ethernet interfaces only, either in
          half duplex, full duplex or in automatic state which negotiates the duplex
          automatically.
        type: str
        choices:
        - full
        - half
        - auto
      template:
        description:
        - IOS template name.
        type: str
  running_config:
    description:
      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the IOS device by
        executing the command B(show running-config | section ^interface).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
        and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  state:
    choices:
    - merged
    - replaced
    - overridden
    - deleted
    - rendered
    - gathered
    - purged
    - parsed
    default: merged
    description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
        on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
        platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
        within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
        not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
        the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
        option should be the same format as the output of command I(show running-config
        | include ip route|ipv6 route) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(purged) negates virtual/logical interfaces that are specified in task
        from running-config.
