description: This module configures and manages the named or numbered ACLs on IOS platforms.
module: ios_acls
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSXE Version 17.3 on CML.
  - Module behavior is not idempotent when sequence for aces are not mentioned
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).

        have config, but for ACL module as the IOS platform doesn't allow
        update of ACE over an pre-existing ACE sequence in ACL, same way ACLs
        resource module will error out for respective scenario and only addition
        of new ACE over new sequence will be allowed with merge state.
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any
        change on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config)
        option to platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in
        the I(rendered) key within the result. For state I(rendered) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device
        and transform it into structured data in the format as per the resource
        module argspec and the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option
        and transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters
        and the value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The
        value of C(running_config) option should be the same format as the output
        of commands I(show access-list) and
        I(show running-config | include ip(v6)* access-list|remark) executed on
        device. Config data from both the commands should be kept together one after
        another for the parsers to pick the commands correctly.
        For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(overridden), modify/add the ACLs defined, deleted all other ACLs.
      - The state I(replaced), modify/add only the ACEs of the ACLs defined only.
        It does not perform any other change on the device.
      - The state I(deleted), deletes only the specified ACLs, or all if not specified.
