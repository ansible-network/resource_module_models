    running_config:
      description:
        - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
        - The value of this option should be the output received from the EOS device by
          executing the command B(show running-config | include hardware fib ecmp resilience).
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
          and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
